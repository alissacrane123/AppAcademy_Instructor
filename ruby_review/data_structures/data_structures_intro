DATA STRUCTURE
- way of storing and organizing data

TREES
- store hierarchy of layers
- an ele (node) at each layer can have links to lower levels
- ex: file system

NODES
- top level node is the `root`
- each node holds a value
- `children` of nodes are nodes one level deeper
- lowest level nodes have no children and are called `leaves`
